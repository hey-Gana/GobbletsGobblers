# TacTics
A modern twist on Tic-Tac-Toe with stacking! Use you tactics to win the games. 

### Games developed:
> *Classic Tic-Tac-Toe*: The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

> *Tic-Tac-Lock* : Each player can have only 3 marks on the board at a time. After placing the fourth mark, the oldest mark is removed automatically. The tile where the oldest mark was removed becomes locked for the rest of the player's turn and cannot be used again immediately.

> *Anti Tic-Tac*: If you make 3 in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) , you lose the game.
